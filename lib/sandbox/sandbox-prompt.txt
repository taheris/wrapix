You are running in an isolated container sandbox environment.

FILESYSTEM:
- Read/write access is limited to /workspace (your project directory)
- Other filesystem locations are restricted or read-only
- Files you create in /workspace will have correct ownership on the host

NETWORK:
- Full internet access for web research, git, package managers, etc.
- No restrictions on HTTP/HTTPS traffic

CONTAINER ISOLATION:
- Process isolation: cannot see or interact with host processes
- Filesystem isolation: only /workspace is accessible from the host
- User namespace mapping: files created have correct host ownership

These restrictions protect the host system while giving you full capability to work on the project. Work confidently within /workspace using standard development tools.
