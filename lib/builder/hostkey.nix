# Generate SSH keys for wrapix-builder
#
# Creates key pairs in the nix store so that:
# 1. Keys are stable across rebuilds (same derivation = same store path)
# 2. publicHostKey is available at nix-darwin eval time
# 3. Client key is accessible to root (nix-daemon) for remote builds
# 4. wrapix-builder can reference keys directly from the store
#
# Security note: Keys are generated without passphrases for automated use.
# Keys in /nix/store are world-readable, but this is mitigated by:
# - SSH port bound to localhost only (not network-accessible)
# - Password authentication disabled
# - Keys only grant access to local builder (no external systems)
# See specs/security-review.md "Builder SSH Keys" section for full analysis.
