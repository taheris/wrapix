{"id":"wx-14772e","title":"Document Claude configuration flow in containers","description":"# Claude Configuration in Containers\n\n## Overview\n\nContainer Claude configuration involves two files:\n- `.claude.json` - User settings (onboarding, updates, etc.)\n- `settings.json` - Environment-persisted settings\n\n## Configuration Flow\n\n### 1. Environment Variables (profiles.nix)\n\nAll containers get these environment variables via `baseEnv`:\n\n```nix\nbaseEnv = {\n  CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC = \"1\";\n  DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER = \"1\";\n  DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING = \"1\";\n  DISABLE_TELEMETRY = \"1\";\n};\n```\n\nThese are baked into the container image (image.nix:112) as `Env` entries.\n\n### 2. .claude.json Initialization (init-claude-config.sh)\n\nOn first container start, entrypoint scripts source `init-claude-config.sh` which creates:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hasCompletedOnboarding\": true,\n  \"autoUpdates\": false,\n  \"numStartups\": 1,\n  \"bypassPermissionsModeAccepted\": true,\n  \"officialMarketplaceAutoInstallAttempted\": true\n}\n```\n\nThis suppresses onboarding prompts and notifications.\n\n### 3. settings.json Persistence\n\n**Why only DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER appears in settings.json:**\n\nClaude CLI reads environment variables on startup and selectively persists certain settings to `~/.claude/settings.json`. The behavior is:\n\n- **DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER** → Persisted to settings.json (user preference)\n- **DISABLE_TELEMETRY** → Runtime-only (not persisted)\n- **DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING** → Runtime-only (not persisted)\n- **CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC** → Runtime-only (not persisted)\n\nThis is Claude CLI's intentional design: user preferences (like auto-updates) are saved to disk, while privacy/telemetry flags are runtime-only and must be set via environment variables each time.\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Container Isolation\n\nThe workspace `.claude` directory is mounted as the container's `~/.claude`:\n\n**Linux** (lib/sandbox/linux/default.nix:60-61):\n```bash\nmkdir -p \"$PROJECT_DIR/.claude\"\nVOLUME_ARGS=\"$VOLUME_ARGS -v $PROJECT_DIR/.claude:/home/$USER/.claude:rw\"\n```\n\n**Darwin** (similar mounting in darwin/default.nix)\n\nThis means:\n- Each project has isolated Claude configuration\n- Sessions persist across container restarts\n- Host `~/.claude` is NOT shared with containers\n\n### Unified Initialization\n\nThe shared `init-claude-config.sh` script is:\n1. Copied into the image at `/etc/wrapix/init-claude-config.sh` (image.nix)\n2. Sourced by both platform entrypoints (linux/entrypoint.sh, darwin/entrypoint.sh)\n3. Creates `.claude.json` if missing\n\nThis eliminates duplication between Linux and Darwin entrypoint scripts.\n\n## Why This Design?\n\n1. **Isolation**: Container config doesn't interfere with host Claude\n2. **Persistence**: Sessions work with `/rename` and `/resume`\n3. **Onboarding**: Suppresses prompts in fresh containers\n4. **Updates**: Prevents containers from auto-updating (version is baked into image)\n5. **Telemetry**: Privacy flags honored without disk persistence","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"chore","owner":"gpg@taheris.net","created_at":"2026-01-22T17:04:13Z","created_by":"unknown","updated_at":"2026-01-25T15:50:58Z","closed_at":"2026-01-25T15:50:58Z","work_type":"mutex"}

Checked Apple container GitHub issues - found #345 (VPN/MTU issues) and #919 (Local Network Privacy)\n\n## Previous Solution (Removed in bcec832)\n\nThe custom Swift runner used gvproxy (gvisor-tap-vsock) for userspace networking:\n- Connected VM to gvproxy via VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment\n- gvproxy handled NAT in userspace, traffic appeared from host IP\n- Host IP is recognized by Tailscale, so routing worked correctly\n\nThis was removed when migrating to Apple container CLI, which manages vmnet internally and doesn't allow custom network attachments.\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n### Option 1: HTTP Proxy on Host (Recommended)\n- Run tinyproxy/mitmproxy on host bound to 192.168.64.1:8080\n- Set HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY in container pointing to gateway\n- Traffic: Container → Proxy → Host network (Tailscale) → Exit node → Internet\n- Pros: Simple, works with current architecture\n- Cons: Proxy config needed, some tools don't respect proxy vars\n\n### Option 2: SOCKS Proxy via SSH Tunnel\n- Create SSH tunnel to exit node: ssh -D 1080 exit-node\n- Configure container to use SOCKS proxy\n- Similar to Option 1 but uses SSH instead of HTTP proxy\n\n### Option 3: Revert to Custom Swift Runner\n- Re-add the Swift runner from before bcec832\n- Use gvproxy for networking as before\n- Pros: Transparent networking, no proxy config\n- Cons: Maintains separate code path, more complex\n\n### Option 4: Tailscale Inside Container\n- Run Tailscale daemon inside container\n- Container joins tailnet directly\n- Pros: Full Tailscale features in container\n- Cons: Auth complexity, resource overhead\n\n## Files Changed (Investigation)\n\n- lib/sandbox/image.nix: Added fakeNss, glibc, NSS symlinks, resolv.conf\n- lib/sandbox/darwin/default.nix: Added --dns 1.1.1.1\n- lib/tests/*.nix: Added --dns 1.1.1.1\n\n## Files to Change (Fix)\n\nFor Option 1 (HTTP Proxy):\n- lib/sandbox/darwin/default.nix: Start proxy, add HTTP_PROXY env vars\n- lib/sandbox/darwin/proxy.nix: New file for tinyproxy package/config\n- flake.nix: Add tinyproxy dependency\n\n## Related\n\n- GitHub issue: https://github.com/apple/container/issues/345\n- Commit that removed gvproxy: bcec832","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-09T14:45:36Z","created_by":"shaun","updated_at":"2026-01-09T18:17:49Z","closed_at":"2026-01-09T18:17:49Z","work_type":"mutex"}

The workflow is:\n1. **Plan phase**: Iterate on plan in markdown (no beads yet - still iterating)\n2. **Finalize**: Convert finalized plan to beads issues\n3. **Build phase**: Work on and close those specific beads\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\n.claude/ralph/\n├── config.nix            # Loop configuration (Nix - native to project)\n├── prompts/\n│   ├── plan.md           # Planning phase prompt\n│   ├── build.md          # Build/implement phase prompt\n│   └── review.md         # Review phase prompt\n├── history/              # Auto-snapshot of prompts per iteration\n│   ├── 001-build.md\n│   └── 002-build.md\n├── state/\n│   └── plan.md           # Draft plan (before finalization to beads)\n└── logs/\n    └── iteration-001.log # Output capture for failure analysis\n```\n\n## Workflow\n\n```\n[Plan Mode] → iterate until satisfied → [ralph-finalize] → creates beads\n     ↓                                                           ↓\nstate/plan.md (markdown)                            bd issues (beads-xxx)\n                                                              ↓\n                                               [Build Mode] → closes beads\n```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Create config schema\n\n**File**: `lib/ralph/init-template/config.nix`\n\n```nix\n{\n  # Active prompt mode: \"plan\" | \"build\" | \"review\"\n  mode = \"plan\";\n\n  # Beads integration\n  beads = {\n    # Label for issues - leave null to auto-generate random 6-char ID\n    # Final label will be prefixed: rl-{label}\n    label = null;\n    priority = 2;       # Default priority (0=critical, 2=medium, 4=backlog)\n  };\n\n  prompts = {\n    plan = \"prompts/plan.md\";\n    build = \"prompts/build.md\";\n    review = \"prompts/review.md\";\n  };\n\n  loop = {\n    max-iterations = 0;       # 0 = infinite\n    pause-on-failure = true;\n    pre-hook = \"\";            # Command to run before each iteration\n    post-hook = \"\";           # Command to run after each iteration\n  };\n\n  history = {\n    enabled = true;\n    max-snapshots = 50;\n  };\n\n  failure-patterns = [\n    { pattern = \"error:\"; action = \"log\"; }      # log | pause | notify\n    { pattern = \"FAILED\"; action = \"pause\"; }\n    { pattern = \"Exception\"; action = \"pause\"; }\n    { pattern = \"BLOCKED:\"; action = \"pause\"; }\n  ];\n\n  exit-signals = {\n    complete = \"PLAN_COMPLETE\";\n    blocked = \"BLOCKED:\";\n    clarify = \"CLARIFY:\";\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create ralph-loop script\n\n**File**: `lib/ralph/loop.sh`\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -euo pipefail\n\nRALPH_DIR=\"${RALPH_DIR:-.claude/ralph}\"\nCONFIG_FILE=\"$RALPH_DIR/config.nix\"\n\n# Load entire config as JSON once at startup\nCONFIG=$(nix eval --json --file \"$CONFIG_FILE\")\n\n# Extract values from cached JSON (no repeated nix eval calls)\nMODE=$(echo \"$CONFIG\" | jq -r '.mode // \"plan\"')\nMAX=$(echo \"$CONFIG\" | jq -r '.loop.\"max-iterations\" // 0')\nPAUSE_ON_FAIL=$(echo \"$CONFIG\" | jq -r '.loop.\"pause-on-failure\" // true')\nHISTORY_ENABLED=$(echo \"$CONFIG\" | jq -r '.history.enabled // true')\nPRE_HOOK=$(echo \"$CONFIG\" | jq -r '.loop.\"pre-hook\" // empty')\nPOST_HOOK=$(echo \"$CONFIG\" | jq -r '.loop.\"post-hook\" // empty')\nCOMPLETE_SIGNAL=$(echo \"$CONFIG\" | jq -r '.\"exit-signals\".complete // \"PLAN_COMPLETE\"')\nPROMPT_PATH=\"$RALPH_DIR/$(echo \"$CONFIG\" | jq -r \".prompts.$MODE // \\\"prompts/plan.md\\\"\")\"\n\nmkdir -p \"$RALPH_DIR/history\" \"$RALPH_DIR/logs\"\n\niteration=0\nwhile :; do\n  ((iteration++))\n  [ \"$MAX\" -gt 0 ] \u0026\u0026 [ \"$iteration\" -gt \"$MAX\" ] \u0026\u0026 { echo \"Max iterations reached\"; break; }\n\n  LOG=\"$RALPH_DIR/logs/iteration-$(printf '%03d' $iteration).log\"\n\n  # Snapshot prompt if history enabled\n  if [ \"$HISTORY_ENABLED\" = \"true\" ]; then\n    cp \"$PROMPT_PATH\" \"$RALPH_DIR/history/$(printf '%03d' $iteration)-$(basename \"$PROMPT_PATH\")\"\n  fi\n\n  # Run pre-hook\n  [ -n \"$PRE_HOOK\" ] \u0026\u0026 eval \"$PRE_HOOK\"\n\n  # Inject iteration and run, capturing output\n  sed \"s/{{ITERATION}}/$iteration/g; s/{{MODE}}/$MODE/g\" \"$PROMPT_PATH\" | \\\n    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions 2\u003e\u00261 | tee \"$LOG\"\n\n  # Check exit signals\n  if grep -q \"$COMPLETE_SIGNAL\" \"$LOG\" 2\u003e/dev/null; then\n    echo \"Loop complete signal received\"\n    break\n  fi\n\n  # Check failure patterns\n  echo \"$CONFIG\" | jq -c '.\"failure-patterns\"[]' | while read -r fp; do\n    pattern=$(echo \"$fp\" | jq -r '.pattern')\n    action=$(echo \"$fp\" | jq -r '.action')\n    if grep -q \"$pattern\" \"$LOG\"; then\n      echo \"Failure detected: $pattern (action: $action)\"\n      if [ \"$action\" = \"pause\" ] \u0026\u0026 [ \"$PAUSE_ON_FAIL\" = \"true\" ]; then\n        echo \"Pausing for prompt tuning.

But state files (plan.md, logs/) would be overwritten.\n\n## Verification\n\n1. Build sandbox: `nix build .#sandbox-linux` (or darwin)\n2. Enter sandbox, verify all ralph-* commands in PATH\n3. Run `ralph-init` - confirm `.claude/ralph/` structure created with config.nix\n4. Run `ralph-loop` with `max-iterations = 1;` in plan mode - verify iteration runs\n5. Create test plan in `state/plan.md` with YAML frontmatter format:\n   ```\n   ---\n   type: task\n   title: Test task\n   priority: 2\n   ---\n   Test description with **markdown**.\n   ```\n6. Run `ralph-finalize`:\n   - Verify `state/label` file created with `rl-{random}` format\n   - Verify beads created with `bd list --labels=$(cat state/label)`\n7. Edit config.nix to set `mode = \"build\";` and run `ralph-loop` - verify it reads beads\n8.
