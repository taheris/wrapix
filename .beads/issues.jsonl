Start the darwin.linux-builder (QEMU VM on port 31022)\n2. Configure as Nix remote builder in /etc/nix/machines\n3. Verify aarch64-linux builds work\n\n### Phase 2: Build NixOS podman-compatible image\n4. Create NixOS configuration for vfkit/Apple Hypervisor:\n   - Use raw-efi disk format\n   - Uncompressed aarch64 kernel (required for Apple VF)\n   - virtio drivers for block, net, console\n   - virtiofs support for host mounts (/Users, /private, /var/folders)\n   - SSH server for remote access\n   - Nix daemon pre-configured\n\n5. Build the image using darwin.linux-builder:\n   ```bash\n   nix build --system aarch64-linux .#nixos-podman-image\n   ```\n\n### Phase 3: Create podman machine with NixOS\n6. Stop existing podman machine: `podman machine stop`\n7. Remove old machine: `podman machine rm podman-machine-default`\n8. Create new machine with NixOS image:\n   ```bash\n   podman machine init --image-path /path/to/nixos.raw nixos-builder\n   ```\n9. Start and configure: `podman machine start nixos-builder`\n\n### Phase 4: Configure as Nix remote builder\n10. Configure SSH access to podman machine\n11.
