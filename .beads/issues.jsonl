TCP connections timeout while ICMP (ping) works.\n\n## Root Cause\n\n1. Apple container CLI uses vmnet for networking (192.168.64.0/24 subnet)\n2. When Tailscale exit node is enabled, ALL traffic routes through Tailscale\n3. Container traffic from 192.168.64.x goes to exit node, but exit node can't NAT responses back to that private IP\n4. \"Allow Local Network Access\" in Tailscale only covers physical LAN, not vmnet's virtual network\n\n## Diagnosis Steps Performed\n\n1. Confirmed networking works with Tailscale off\n2. Confirmed ping works but TCP fails with Tailscale on (exit node intercepts TCP)\n3. Confirmed MTU adjustment doesn't help (tried 1220)\n4. Confirmed this is NOT an NSS/DNS issue - added fakeNss, glibc, resolv.conf correctly\n5. Checked Apple container GitHub issues - found #345 (VPN/MTU issues) and #919 (Local Network Privacy)\n\n## Previous Solution (Removed in bcec832)\n\nThe custom Swift runner used gvproxy (gvisor-tap-vsock) for userspace networking:\n- Connected VM to gvproxy via VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment\n- gvproxy handled NAT in userspace, traffic appeared from host IP\n- Host IP is recognized by Tailscale, so routing worked correctly\n\nThis was removed when migrating to Apple container CLI, which manages vmnet internally and doesn't allow custom network attachments.\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n### Option 1: HTTP Proxy on Host (Recommended)\n- Run tinyproxy/mitmproxy on host bound to 192.168.64.1:8080\n- Set HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY in container pointing to gateway\n- Traffic: Container → Proxy → Host network (Tailscale) → Exit node → Internet\n- Pros: Simple, works with current architecture\n- Cons: Proxy config needed, some tools don't respect proxy vars\n\n### Option 2: SOCKS Proxy via SSH Tunnel\n- Create SSH tunnel to exit node: ssh -D 1080 exit-node\n- Configure container to use SOCKS proxy\n- Similar to Option 1 but uses SSH instead of HTTP proxy\n\n### Option 3: Revert to Custom Swift Runner\n- Re-add the Swift runner from before bcec832\n- Use gvproxy for networking as before\n- Pros: Transparent networking, no proxy config\n- Cons: Maintains separate code path, more complex\n\n### Option 4: Tailscale Inside Container\n- Run Tailscale daemon inside container\n- Container joins tailnet directly\n- Pros: Full Tailscale features in container\n- Cons: Auth complexity, resource overhead\n\n## Files Changed (Investigation)\n\n- lib/sandbox/image.nix: Added fakeNss, glibc, NSS symlinks, resolv.conf\n- lib/sandbox/darwin/default.nix: Added --dns 1.1.1.1\n- lib/tests/*.nix: Added --dns 1.1.1.1\n\n## Files to Change (Fix)\n\nFor Option 1 (HTTP Proxy):\n- lib/sandbox/darwin/default.nix: Start proxy, add HTTP_PROXY env vars\n- lib/sandbox/darwin/proxy.nix: New file for tinyproxy package/config\n- flake.nix: Add tinyproxy dependency\n\n## Related\n\n- GitHub issue: https://github.com/apple/container/issues/345\n- Commit that removed gvproxy: bcec832","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-09T14:45:36.761979Z","created_by":"shaun","updated_at":"2026-01-09T18:17:49.36647Z","closed_at":"2026-01-09T18:17:49.36647Z","close_reason":"Fixed by disabling 'Allow Local Network Access' in Tailscale settings.
