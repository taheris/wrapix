# Example judge rubric — reference for writing new judge tests.
#
# Each function defines a rubric by calling:
#   judge_files   — source files the LLM reads
#   judge_criterion — what the LLM evaluates
#
# Rubric functions are referenced from spec success criteria annotations:
#   - [ ] Output includes progress percentage
#     [judge](tests/judges/example.sh::test_progress_display)
#
# When ralph spec --judge runs, it sources this file, calls the function,
# then passes the files + criterion to an LLM for PASS/FAIL evaluation.
