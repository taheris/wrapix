# unshare(1) to create a user namespace that maps inner HOST_UID to outer UID 0,
# so all files (including VirtioFS mounts) appear with correct ownership.

# Precondition: VirtioFS must be in use. VirtioFS maps all files to UID 0 inside
# the container. When running outside an Apple Container VM (e.g., via wrapix-debug
# on Linux), VirtioFS is not present and this test is not applicable.
